<p>Execution</p>
<p>Lift bar by extending hips and knees to full extension. Pull shoulders back at top of lift if rounded. Return weights to floor by bending hips back while allowing knees to bend forward, keeping back straight and knees pointed same direction as feet. Repeat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Comments</p>
<p>Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps, grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip. Lever barbell jack can be used to lift barbell from floor for easier loading and unloading of weight plates.</p>

Dips,8,"<p>Hold onto the bars at a narrow place (if they are not parallel) and press yourself up, but don't stretch the arms completely, so the muscles stay during the whole exercise under tension.

Narrow, shoulder-width dips primarily train the triceps, with major synergists being the anterior deltoid, the pectoralis muscles (sternal, clavicular, and minor), and the rhomboid muscles of the back (in that order).[1] Wide arm training places additional emphasis on the pectoral muscles, similar in respect to the way a wide grip bench press would focus more on the pectorals and less on the triceps.",

Front Raises,13,"<p>To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.</p>
<p>The movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.</p>
<p>When lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.</p>
<p>A neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff.</p>","1,3"

Muscle up,12,"<p>The body is then explosively pulled up by the arms in a radial pull-up, with greater speed than a regular pull-up.

The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.</p>
<p>To dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.</p>
<p>As a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion.</p>",6

Russian Twist,10,"<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_twist</p> Another Description is : <p>First, one should sit on the floor with knees bent as in a ""sit-up"" position. The feet should be kept together and slightly above the ground or put under a stable surface. The torso should be kept straight with the back kept off the ground at a 45 degree angle. Arms should be held together away from the body in a straight fashion and hands kept locked together like a ball or one can hold a weight to increase the difficulty. Next, the arms should be swung from one side to another in a twisting motion, with each swing to a side counting as one repetition. The slower one moves the arms from side to side, the harder the exercise becomes, working the abdomen that much better. When moving one's arms during the exercise, it is crucial to not stop between repetitions or else one will lose the effect of working the abdomen. Constant breathing in and out during the exercise is important as one should not hold one's breath</p>
<p>- Wikipedia</p> Another Description is : <ol>
<li>Lie down on the floor placing your feet either under something that will not move or by having a partner hold them. Your legs should be bent at the knees.</li>
<li>Elevate your upper body so that it creates an imaginary V-shape with your thighs. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you perpendicular to your torso and with the hands clasped. This is the starting position.</li>
<li>Twist your torso to the right side until your arms are parallel with the floor while breathing out.</li>

Two Dumbbell Clean And Press,13,"<p> </p>
<p>How to Clean and Press</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I mentioned, the technique for a dumbbell clean isn't quite as simple as doing a barbell clean while holding a pair of dumbbells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First of all, a seven-foot long bar forces you to take a pronated grip (palms down, knuckles facing front). That's how we clean or snatch; it's usually how we deadlift; it's how we instinctually grab the bar when we're about to do almost anything with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pair of dumbbells not only don't force you to have any particular hand position, other than the one you find most comfortable or powerful, it actually makes it unnaturally clumsy to try to maintain a barbell-esque pronated grip at the start of the exercise. The most efficient way of doing a dumbbell clean is to not think about doing a clean at all. Think of doing a ""power hammer curl from the floor.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Begin with the dumbbells on the ground just outside your feet, with the left dumbbell pointing roughly ""1 and 7"" on a clock and the right dumbbell pointing roughly ""11 and 5."" Squat down, feet being a comfortable width apart, and grab both dumbbells. Your arms should be able to slide down along the outside of your legs, without the legs interfering in keeping the arms locked at the start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keeping a flat back, begin the dumbbell clean using the same lower body and torso position as with a barbell, allowing the dumbbells to rise next to or slightly in front of your legs. As the weights approach your knees, explode up with maximum force and control the weights enough to keep them from looping too far forward, while also maintaining a predominantly thumbs-up, hammer curl-type orientation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Receive the weight by catching it with a slight dip as it comes to rest in front of your shoulders, elbows pushed forward so you look like a slightly-awkward midpoint of a legit hammer curl.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Congrats, you've just completed the first half of a dumbbell clean and press. Unfortunately, it's like wrapping up foreplay with Khloe Kardashian. If you thought that was tough to get through, you're not gonna enjoy the next part, either.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immediately take a quick breath in, brace your abs and glutes, and press the weights overhead. No jerky or jumping leg drive. This isn't a clean and push press, so keep it strict. If you're pressing for any substantial number of reps, you'll find it easiest to maintain a mostly-neutral grip, rather than externally rotating the arms to get the dumbbells into ""regular"" press position (palms facing forward).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Preserving muscular energy whenever possible goes a long way with such a big exercise. While a neutral-grip overhead press will slightly increase the front delt and triceps activation, you'll also be starting the press from a stronger biomechanical position (with the elbows brought in rather than rotated out), which will maintain joint health and could improve pressing strength – a pretty solid tradeoff in my book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once both arms are locked out overhead, take another quick breath before lowering the weights to your shoulders (either hand orientation, neutral or pronated, is fine), then lower them to the waist as in the negative of a quick hammer curl, catching them with a knee dip and a flat back to lessen the impact on the wrist, elbow, shoulder, and low back, and then squat to place them on the ground.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of that makes one rep, and you're doing how many more this set?</p>",3
